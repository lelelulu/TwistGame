Review Comments:
1- in my opinion the best features of this code is that the isPlacementWellFormed and isPlacementStringWellFormed methods confirms that each piece and peg contain exactly 4 character and these four character is ranked and each character means the row or column and so on; therefore, when moving the pieces and pegs we can determine where they will be exactly on the board.

2- I think this code well-documented because if the pieces and pegs was wrong formatted the whole game would not work.

3-I think yes the program decomposition (class and method structure) appropriate for the same reason that the pieces and pegs should be well formatted and duplication will not appear in the pieces  and pegs on the board.

4- yes this code follow Java code conventions and the style consistent throughout because the names and the entire code can be understood easily.

5- I think there is no error in this code for both methods.
